plone.app.tiles todo
====================

[ ] Maybe we can avoid the ++addtile++ and ++edittile++ namespaces by
    implement __getitem__() in the Tile class to do the triple-adapter lookups
    for us instead. That way, the path would be ../@@tilename/add or
    ../@@tilename/add. Alternatively, we could have standard @@add-tile and
    @@edit-tile views with a __getitem__ doing what traverseName() does now.

[ ] Book-keeping for which tiles have been persisted in annotations, to allow
    a "delete all" or selection of tile ids to delete. This may be done using
    events.

[ ] Taking the handleCancel method to the tileForm class so as the code is the same
    This can also be done with other code in the add and edit forms
