plone.app.tiles todo
====================

[ ] Book-keeping for which tiles have been persisted in annotations, to allow
    a "delete all" or selection of tile ids to delete. This may be done using
    events.

[ ] Taking the handleCancel method to the tileForm class so as the code is the same
    This can also be done with other code in the add and edit forms
